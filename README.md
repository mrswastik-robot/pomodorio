a straightforward Pomodoro timer that allows users to customize their focus and break durations. Seeking to differentiate this timer from others, I conceived the idea of a global chat feature. During designated break periods, a chat box will enable users to engage in discussionsâ€”ideal for collaborative study sessions among groups of students who can track each other's progress and share insights during breaks.
